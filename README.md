Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Project setup part 0.5
In order to run this project you need node version >= 16. (node -v) to check.

The easiest way to change the node version you're using is to get nvm.

After you install nvm in your terminal just type nvm use 16 and you'll be on node version 16

then cd music app

```bash
yarn
```
then 

```bash
yarn run dev
```



## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
yarn run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn run build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
